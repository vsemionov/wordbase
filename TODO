0.3:
- replace psycopg2 with pg8000 and enable socket timeout?
- redis on-demand connections and connection pooling

0.4:
- some sort of failover after a redis server fails and fallback after recovery; if all servers fail, the cache should fail silently (without disconnecting the client)

0.5:
- threadpool mp module? the threads in the pool should have all necessary resources (db connections) preallocated in order to avoid the overhead of allocating them when the client connects
