0.2.1:
- fix segfault when a thread attempts to fetch data from redis after another thread previously failed to connect to redis; to reproduce, configure wordbase with thread mp module, stop redis, start wordbase, connect a client (which fails), start redis, connect a second client and issue "d hello"; result - the python interpreter segfaults

0.3:
- pgsql on-demand connections and connection pooling
- redis on-demand connections and connection pooling
